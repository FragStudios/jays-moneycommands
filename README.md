Simple script to show player's cash, bank and crypto amount using ox_lib. 

If you don't use qb-hud, it typically removes the commands if your current HUD resource doesn't contain these commands. (Mine doesn't hence why I made this)

Created for use with QBOX servers.

I seen someone do about 10 events just to do what I am doing here. Thought i'd simplify and share with the QBOX community 

QBOX ON TOP ‚ù§
